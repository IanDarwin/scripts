This is Ian's collection of *Nix scripts, in continuous use and development since 1984.
I know the earliest repo date is 1994, but hey, CVS didn't even exist when I started,
let alone this new-fangled stuff like git (which came along two full decades into the project).

Most of the scripts may run on any modern POSIX/Unix/Linux system, but some will not.
While the early work was done on PDP-11 Unix, Solaris, and other systems including Linux,
almost all the recent work has been on OpenBSD and Mac OS X.
Also, some of them depend on having installed certain Java programs (some of which
can be found in my other repos). Some install in your Maven repo (~/.m2/repository)
while others install in ~/lib or even elsewhere.
So if one of them doesn't work for you, bear in mind that there are lots of
variations out there.

Also, note in the shebang line that various non-shell interpreters are use for some of the scripts.

Some of the scripts are well documented, some have almost no documentation.
No claim is made that anything here is product-ready in a commercial sense.

USE AT OWN RISK.
